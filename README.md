# 🎮 Dota2 Flexbox Playground  
_A fun, flex-powered navigation & mega-menu layout inspired by Dota 2!_

---

## ✨ Why I Built This
I've been diving into CSS Flexbox lately, and wanted to create a **navigation bar** and **mega-menu** with a bit of Dota 2 flair.  
The goal? Experiment with `display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and mega-menus—all in a playful learning project.  
Responsiveness? Nah, not the point… yet! 😉

## 🛠️ Features
- ⚡ Flexible layout using pure **Flexbox** (no floats or grid)  
- 🧭 Horizontal **navigation bar** with clean styling  
- 📂 **Mega-menu** dropdown with a game-inspired vibe  
- 🎯 Built as a hands-on practice sandbox—nothing fancy, just fun!
